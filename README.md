# Design Teardown

This project is part of The Odin Project's HTML/CSS course. Can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/design-teardown). The goal was to take the [Smashing Magazine website](http://smashingmagazine.com/) and make a greyscale heatmap depending on their visual hierarchy.
